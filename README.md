# Button Game

Button Game built with Zeit Now and NextJS.

## Description

The challenge is to write a useful user interface for The Button. The Button
is a social game, similar to that of [Reddit's Button](https://goo.gl/ad1MhC)
where any number of users can all press a button. Pressing the button costs
ether, but if the button remains unpressed for 3 or more blocks (roughly 30
seconds), the last presser can claim all the money pressed. After claiming, the
game starts over the next time someone presses the button.

## To run locally
